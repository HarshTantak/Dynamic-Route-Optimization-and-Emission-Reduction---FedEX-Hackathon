# Real-time emission reduction using a dynamic route optimisation approach based on data 
The transportation and logistics sector's greatest obstacle is achieving an equilibrium between minimizing environmental impact and ensuring on-time delivery. In order to deal with these challenges, this project proposes a dynamic routing system that optimises routes, forecasts travel times, and estimates emissions using real-time data from several APIs. This strategy will integrate various sources, including OSRM route generation, TomTom traffic, Google Maps for location and routing, AQICN weather and air quality, and ClimateQ carbon footprint.

## There will be four main phases to its process. 
1. Dynamic Data Integration: We construct a strong data infrastructure that is adaptable sufficient to update in real time. Here, we set up APIs that will retrieve both current and historical data so that they can adapt to changing circumstances. 
2. Predictive traffic modelling: For predicting foreseeable traffic conditions, a hybrid KNN-ANN model is utilised. The idea behind this method is that an ANN model uses the base traffic data from KNN to increase the prediction accuracy and determine the optimal routing.
3. enhancing Vehicle-Specific Routes : Our system includes vehicle-specific optimization strategies in recognition of the fact that various delivery operations differ in their nature. Heuristic sequencing algorithms handle idle time according to delivery schedules and vehicle type. A* algorithms are additionally employed to keep pathways optimized, and an ANN is applied to generate dynamic decisions when the route is being executed. 
4. Real-Time Travel Time and Emission Analysis:  Our system assesses travel times employing real-time forecasting algorithms that adjust dynamically to unanticipated events, traffic variants, and environmental factors. Importantly, the system determines carbon emissions for each path, providing insightful information for reducing environmental impact and encouraging sustainable behaviours. 

There are numerous advantages to this comprehensive framework that uses intelligent routing and predictive analytics: 
Reduced Carbon Footprint: Since the system immediately decreases emission levels, reducing idle time and optimizing routes will ultimately result in a lower carbon footprint. 
Improved operational efficiency: In real time shifts and optimized routes results in quicker shipping times and more effectively resource utilization. 
Improved Customer Satisfaction: Timely arrivals and accurate shipping estimates contribute to higher customer satisfaction. 

This project demonstrates the effectiveness of integrating innovative algorithms with real-time data to build a more efficient and environmentally friendly logistics and transportation ecosystem.
